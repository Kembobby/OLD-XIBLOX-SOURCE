a tutorial for the current source code - extract the zip like always, there is no db added in the zip cuz we ain't letting skidders skid so make one yourself. You gotta use myphpadmin for the db/sql, if you try to report a xiblox clone just 3 words,    w e      d o n ' t      c a r e ! ! !

quick tutorial for the xdoblox one - you don't need a db cuz this was coded in html, no not php. The xdoblox version is like a fucking simulator to me ðŸ˜­ (don't forget that i didn't do all of the work on this src), so if you wanna use this just do it please im tired of owning this shitty src.

Thanks for reading, if you wanna install the WHOLE src not my choice do it, also OG site is 2008.ct8.pl and otherdomain is xiblox.xyz (which died).
